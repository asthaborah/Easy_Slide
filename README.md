Security Measures

Easy_Slide prioritizes the security of your website and data by implementing several protective measures:

    1. Data Escaping: All displayed data is properly escaped to guard against XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks.
    2. Nonces: Nonces are employed to ensure that requests from the plugin settings page are legitimate, 
       preventing CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) attacks.
    3. Input Filtering and Sanitization: All user inputs are meticulously filtered and sanitized to prevent any 
       malicious input from compromising the plugin or your website.

Steps to Use Easy_Slide

    1. Activate the Plugin: After activation, a new admin menu with two submenus will appear: "Add Slide" and "Manage Slide".
    2. Add Slide:

      o Upload a featured image (background image of the slide).
      o Use the custom meta box to:

      o Repeat to add 4-5 Easy_Slide posts.
    3. Create a Post:
      o Add a title and content.
